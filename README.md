Introduction: 

New York City is home to over 8 million people and more than 1,700 parks, playgrounds, and public green
spaces. While the city has invested heavily in urban greenery, not all neighborhoods have equal access.
Research shows that limited access to parks can increase public health risks, such as heat stress,
respiratory illness, and reduced opportunities for recreation. This issue is particularly relevant in low-
income and minority communities, where access to safe and clean green space is often lacking.


Method: 

Parks and green space layers were mapped across the five boroughs.
Census tract data for population density and socioeconomic characteristics were overlaid.
400-meter (5-minute walk) and 800-meter (10-minute walk) buffers were created around parks to estimate accessibility.
Ratios of park area per 1,000 residents were calculated to assess fairness in park distribution.
Patterns of inequality were visualized and compared across neighborhoods.
